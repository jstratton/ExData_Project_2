# ExData_Project_2

## This is the repository for my Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 2.
* This project deals with particulate matter pollution data.
* Specifically, the EPA's PM2.5 data from 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

## Objective: practice using R for exploratory data analysis.

## Two data sets were included with this assignment:
* A data set containing the PM2.5 measurements for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
* A code classifying each of the sources in the PM2.5 Dataset
